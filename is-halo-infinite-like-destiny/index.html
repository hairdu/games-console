<p>Halo Infinites campaign overview and trailer suggest 343 Industries could adopt a similar model to that of Destiny 2 for the games future. So like in Destiny 2 its a very good idea to stick close to your teammates most of the time since combined fire makes opponents much easier to bring down. As a long time Halo Fanboy I must say Halo Infinite should be a Shared World Shooter like Destiny but with better Graphics no Loot Boxes like Halo 5 with a better Story written by Joseph Statin and the Music done by Martin ODonnell. I know 343 can do it. When playing in Multiplayer everyone starts with the same weapons and itll up to you to scour the map to find better guns.</p>

<p>Odds of Washington dying of old age before beating Halo 2 on Legendary 710 20k level 2 Jolactus 11m This is the only correct response yet. You are very weak and this time you dont have that additional buffer of health like you did in Halo CE 2. Halo 2 is slightly longer at around 9-10 hours.

The first mission is awful on solo legendary but after that the game isnt too difficult.

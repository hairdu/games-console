<p>What makes Spisaks return surprising is Wally West died in the final. Ever since her boyfriend Wally WestKid Flash Jason Spisak was killed in Young Justice. He also has come to accept both the original Roy and Jim as his family even suggesting they join his business. Producer Greg Weisman keeps a timeline document that the shows writers and producers use while creating the series.

I have been hoping like everyone else for quite some time that Wally will return in a similar fashion to Barry Allen when he was trapped in the Speed Force.

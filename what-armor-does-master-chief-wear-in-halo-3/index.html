<p>The Alpha helmet is visually based on the variant the Master Chief wore - the Delta helmet is actually based on the Halo 3 version of the helmet which is distinct and built in Seongnam.

And i dont see how they would change the armor since he was aboard the ship in cyro sleep after halo 3 and seemingly woke up from an uninterrupted sleep in halo 4. We would like to show you a description here but the site wont allow us.</p>

<p>The finished Halo project ended up on the Xbox because Bungie had royally screwed the pooch with a botched release of their previous game Myth II. CE is a First-person shooter science-fiction video game created by Bungie Studios which was a subsidiary of Microsoft Game Studios at that time. In all honesty I dont even think the Destiny series is great. As Halo was owned directly by Microsoft they created a sub-brunch now known as 343 Industries which is directly part of Microsoft itself.

<p><strong>Will The New Halo Have A Battle Royale</strong>, There will also purportedly be two Halo spin-off games but no official sequels to Halo Infinite. The claims themselves are that 343 Industries is aiming for a release date between March and June of 2021 and that there will be a battle royale mode in Halo Infinite although this isnt being developed by 343. Halo Infinite likely wont have a battle royale mode at launch but its possible that one will come in the future. A year is a long time though and if a new listing on Microsofts official Japanese website is to be believed the epic sci-fi.</p>

<p>Halo Infinite likely wont have a battle royale mode at launch but its possible that one will come in the future. As of this writing 343 Industries and Microsoft have yet to ensure fans that a Halo Infinite Battle Royale is in the works likely due to the ongoing Flight Test. There will also purportedly be two Halo spin-off games but no official sequels to Halo Infinite. This weeks Halo Infinite Flight Test will focus on the Big Team Battle pitting 12 players against 12 others so the online stability of those games will probably be their focus at least for now.

<p>This is just a Thoughtbut actually Halos Death would make a lot of sense. This article is about the Cadmus-created clone. The Young Justice season 4 mid-season finale brought the battle between Order and Chaos to a close while setting the stage for the conflicts to come in the series second half in 2022. But still my biggest issue for her in that show is just how she kept being worfed to show threats.

<p>Death Halo did die in a manner of speaking in a much later incident. Halo was finally taken to the Justice League Satellite where the Outsiders managed to recover her memories as an Aurakle but with her memory restored she was taken away by the rest of the Aurakles who had come to separate the human body from the energy being. The Young Justice season 4 mid-season finale brought the battle between Order and Chaos to a close while setting the stage for the conflicts to come in the series second half in 2022. Im a Muslim myself and I feel that the character is handled very poorly especially for someone that serves to add inclusivity into a somewhat mainstream show.

<p>Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has pulled out of producing future Spider - Man movies. In a few years Marvel may lose the rights to major characters such as Spider-Man Iron Man Black Widow and more due to the copyrights on those characters expiring. This is one of the most noticeable changes in the game. Sony bought the rights to Spiderman.

<p>Disney is fighting to retain copyright ownership of major MCU heroes arguing that Marvel is actually the original owner of these characters. Insomniacs Creative Director Bryan Intihar stated on Twitter that the reason for the change was because in order to make even more believable-looking characters for the PS5 the team needed an actor with a better facial match for Yuri Lowenthal.

From my understanding Sony Pictures and Marvel started to discuss a possible shared cinematic universe with Spider-Man appearing in Marvel films as seen in Captain America.

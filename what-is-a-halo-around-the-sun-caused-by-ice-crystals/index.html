Cirrus clouds are so high in the sky typically higher than 20000 feet they are made up of millions upon millions of tiny ice crystals which readily refract the light from the Sun or Moon.

<p>Cirrus clouds are so high in the sky typically higher than 20000 feet they are made up of millions upon millions of tiny ice crystals which readily refract the light from the Sun or Moon. One Saturday night in 2012 was just such a time near Madrid Spain where a winter sky displayed not only a bright Moon but four rare lunar halos. Sundogs are colored spots of light that develop due to the refraction of light through ice crystals. A halo is a ring or light that forms around the sun or moon as the sun or moon light refracts off ice crystals present in a thin veil of cirrus clouds. Pwfwsfjknixfm.</p>

<p>They are located approximately 22 degrees. The halo that appeared around the Sun is a 22-degree ring that appears due to the dispersion of light as white light passes through ice crystals found in upper-level cirrus clouds causing the halo to have colours. Sometimes falling ice crystals make the atmosphere into a giant lens causing arcs and halos to appear around the Sun or Moon.

<p>Sundogs are colored spots of light that develop due to the refraction of light through ice crystals. The halos you see are caused by both refraction or splitting of light and also by reflection or glints of light from these ice crystals.

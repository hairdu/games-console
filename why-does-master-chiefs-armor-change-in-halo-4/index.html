<p><strong>Why Does Master Chiefs Armor Change In Halo 4</strong>, In Halo 4 Chief wears the same suit of GEN1 MJOLNIR Mark VI as he did in Halo 2 and 3. This leads us to believe that Cortana had some play in the changes to the Mjölnir mark 6 after all she did just kinda sit there and kill time for like 4 years. And i dont see how they would change the armor since he was aboard the ship in cyro sleep after halo 3 and seemingly woke up from an uninterrupted sleep in halo 4. In Halo 4 he has the Spartan IV version but he still has the damage.</p>

<p>Halogen gas - the gas inside of the halogen bulb combines with the tungsten vapor given off by the filament the part that gets hot and emits light. An oxyacid has the general structure X-O-H. The formula is H X where X is one of the halogens. Halogens have a small size due to their effective nuclear charge.</p>

<p>The halogens are fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine. Halogens form monobasic acids with hydrogen and their hydroxides fluorine forms none are also monobasic acids. In the literature on halogen bonding the reader should be alert to how the words donor and acceptor are used. They were given the name halogen from the Greek roots hal- salt and -gen to produce because they all produce sodium salts of similar properties of. The term halogen means salt-former and compounds containing halogens are called salts.</p>

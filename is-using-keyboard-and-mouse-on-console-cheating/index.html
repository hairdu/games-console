<p>No using a mouse and keyboard on console is not cheating. PS4 and Xbox One both feature integrated keyboard and mouse support that wouldnt have been implemented if it allowed players to easily cheat the system. Not cheating but if there are ever tournaments on console mk wouldnt be allowed. I consider players using Mouse and Keyboards on Console to be cheating especially in many TDs.

<p>Is using mouse and keyboard on console cheating. Rainbow Six is made to not allow keyboard and mouse. So the only way to actually stop MnK in r6 console is if either the console Sony or Microsoft or r6s anti cheat softwares can pick up that a third party hardware is connected to the console. There are stil some games I still need the feel of a controller for but liking the mousekeyboard so far.

<p>Never played with friends before or even added someone as friend into the game. Then in the Epic Games account click Add Friend Steam should appear as an option. 265 November 29 Got a friend that will start playing when the game will go free on Epic Store while I will play on Steam and I have no idea how to make the crossplay between the two launchers work. So im a DBD steam player but my friends picked up DBD from the Epic store while its still free to grab and i was wondering if the crossplay between both platforms is possible and if yes i do i invite them to play with me. Pin On Dbd.</p>

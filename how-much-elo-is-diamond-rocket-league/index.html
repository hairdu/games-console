<p>Competitive Tournaments is a Ranked mode that pits you against teams of similar skill to earn rewards. If this was CSGO thatd be equivalent to Legendary Eagle or a Distinguished Master Guardian close to ranking up so its a pretty decent rank and way above the average Rocket League player which is probably between Silver III and Gold II. I would say my skillevel is much higher im on 3v3 team 700 Points and Double over 600. Rocket league boost can be conducted in 1v1s 2v2s as well as 3v3s formats.

<p>Halo 2s Legendary difficulty is one of if not the hardest first-person-shooter campaigns to ever exist. Halo 2 is the only one Id classify as having unfair difficulty spikes the other games you just need to take it slow. If youre reading this theres a good chance you own or will soon own a copy of Bungies awesome first-person shooter. I found Normal to be a little too easy with the exception of boss fights that possessed sudden difficulty spikes that required you to make ample use of Chiefs abilities and a liberal abuse of energy weapons to whittle down enemy shields.

<p>Actually Elite shields are bullet eaters in Halo 1-2-3-Reach on Legendary. And that flavour tastes an awful lot like bullshit. That said Id still recommend you try it the right way first with the exception of the sniper jackals on metropolis. Its more so about their precision and aggression towards you that makes it more difficult. Halo Infinite S Normal Difficulty Is Harder Than You D Expect.</p>

<p>That all said I have to disagree about the difficulty of both I think theyre 2 of the easiest soulsbourne like games. I think having a cac is better more the series since I dont think Nioh 1 did enough with William to really warrant having a set protagonist. An epic tale of love and betrayals that i will never forget. Its definitely got a great story and is much more character driven than DSBB.</p>

Nioh has an amazing story. 0 Reply Share ReportSaveFollow level 2 Op 1 yr. Nioh 2 has less traditional story again with historical figures and events but this time it follows decades long timeline and you need to dig a bit deeper if you want to be clear of everything thats happening. It might let you enjoy the story a bit more if you knew some this history.</p>

<p>If people arent enjoying the story thats almost 100 because the story is poorly told. This game is far from perfect. Sekiro moved on from the traditional soulsbourne formula and Nioh embraces it.

<p>First the stories of both games are pretty mediocre and forgettable though Nioh 2 has a slightly better story. Nioh follows the story William in pursuit of Edward Kelley who has captured and stole his Guardian Spirit Saoirse. Its no masterpiece but its far from bad. If Nioh had a great story.

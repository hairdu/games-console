<p>We havent really seen much of legacy dungeons but Id say it will probably have similar design elements as in most From Soft games except with the added open world. I certainly wont go as far as to say Elden Ring is easier than Dark Souls or Sekiro especially after one particular boss fight but I can confidently say this team made huge strides in. Shadows Die Twice or Bloodborne instead falling somewhere in line with Dark Souls III. Elden Ring FromSoftwares upcoming title received a new gameplay trailer recently.

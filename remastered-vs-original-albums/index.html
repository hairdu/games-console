<p>Maybe I should start another thread for peoples opinions on specific CDsAlbums remastered releases. There was 1996 remasters. Overall the remaster appears to be ever so slightly more compressed but the overall level is a tad lower so theres less digital clipping and maybe a bit more range in the peaks despite being slightly more compressed. Anyone have experience with that one. Vintage Saxy Jazz Vinyl Lp Bill Black S Combo Original Etsy In 2021 Lp Albums Album Sleeves Record Album.</p>

<p>But theres a lot of 1980s original pressings of CD albums in my Dads. I just ordered Steely Dan Aja remastered in Nov 23 1999. The latest remasters are sourced from better tapes the original master tapes to be precise while older issues often came from copy masters that were several generations removed from the originals. Price is also a factor so Im open to remastered versions. What Is The Greatest Not Officially Released Album Led Zeppelin Albums Led Zeppelin Album Covers Led Zeppelin I.</p>

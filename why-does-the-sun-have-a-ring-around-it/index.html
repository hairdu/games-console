<p><strong>Why Does The Sun Have A Ring Around It</strong>, Particles could rain into Saturn or dissipate to space. If you could look at the crystals under the microscope you. Also known as a 22 degree halo or a sun halo the ring is caused by sunlight passing through ice crystals in cirrus clouds within the Earths atmosphere the University of Illinois Weather World Project 2010 explains.

<p>It is called a halo and these are very common when we have high cirrus clouds in the atmosphere. A ring around the moon or sun is caused by ice crystal in the upper atmosphere. This also means the rings have a radius of about 22 degrees around the moon or sun That is why this occurrence is also referred to as 22-degree halos by scientists and meteorologists. The reason they are so bright is because the ice reflects light from the sun giving them a brilliant glow.</p>

<p>The properties of the ice crystals reflect and refract light in such a way as to cause a ring around the sun. What are Saturns rings made of. As the moons themselves migrate outward the ring particles they herd will spread out. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22-degree angle creating a halo 22 degrees in radius or 44 degrees in diameter. It is typically caused when there are very high very thin clouds.</p>

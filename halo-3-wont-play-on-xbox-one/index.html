<p>Halo Infinite provides an amazing experience across the Xbox One and newer family of consoles as well as PC with stunning 4K graphics and world-class cross-platform play. I was continuing to play Halo infinite and suddenly tried to change graphics mode from performance to quality. I recently downloaded Halo MCC through the Xbox beta app on my Windows 10 PC through the Game Pass. It proceeds to open a new Window for Microsoft asking me to sign in.

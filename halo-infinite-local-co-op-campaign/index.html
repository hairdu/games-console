<p>Many Halo Infinite fans have been patiently waiting for the games upcoming co-op campaign which has yet to release with the main game. 343 Industries has clarified rumors surrounding Halo Infinite stating that the shooter will support 2-player splitscreen as well as 4-player co-op online but not four players locally. And that is because the games in this series actually provided a good co-op experience for you and your friends. The omission of this feature was a disappointment for many players.

<p>Like the Halo Master Chief Collection Halo Infinite will revolve around a season philosophy of regular updates each lasting about three months Staten says that. The omission of this feature was a disappointment for many players. For split-screen multiplayer 343 Industries did previously confirm that Halo Infinite will feature local multiplayer and its current store listing confirms these plans as. Season 1 of the multiplayer is currently slated to end on May 2 2021 so its safe to assume May 2022 is when the co-op campaign will arrive.

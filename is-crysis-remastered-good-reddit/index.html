<p>Crysis 1 on Delta with Advanced AI Mod and a graphic config is one of my favorite FPS experiences and i play FPS Games for 25 Years. This wasnt a thing in the original games and it is pretty annoying. Yes its a remaster but wow are the graphics measurably improved here. Playing through Crysis remastered on Hard too took a break from that to do Warhead at about the point it takes place in the Crysis story not exact just around where I reckoned. Crysis Remastered Ps5 Update Adds 60fps For The Next Gen Console.</p>

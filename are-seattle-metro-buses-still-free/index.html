<p>Swift uses ticket-vending machines and off-board ORCA readers allowing for appropriate physical distancing from the coach operators to continue. All Community Transit buses went fare-free Friday. Beginning June 1 Community Transit will be collecting fares on its Swift bus rapid transit lines while other routes remain fare-free until further notice. Passengers have been able to ride Metrobus for free since early in the pandemic but that will change in a few weeks. Metro S Fleet Will Be All Electric Also Much Smaller Seattle Transit Blog.</p>

<p>Metro says winter weather is still impacting their services and that all passengers should dress warmly and allow for extra time. The new Metro Transit began operation on January 1 1973 and in 1974 it began working on fleshing-out the plans to rehabilitate and expand Seattles trolleybus network hiring a consulting firm in 1975 to carry out the technical aspects of the design. With our belief in mobility as a human right we focus first on safety equity and sustainability. Sound Transit will also go temporarily fare-free ask passengers to board its ST Express buses through the back door when possible and reduce train and bus service.

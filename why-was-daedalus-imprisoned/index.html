<p>Minos was horrified and in fury he imprisoned Daedalus in a tower. Why did Minos imprison Daedalus in the labyrinth. With all other means of escape seemingly denied to him Daedalus set to constructing wings for himself and his son Icarus so that they could fly out. Daedalus carefully instructed his son how to use the wings to fly He warned Icarus not to fly too high or too low. The Flight Of Icarus Icarus Paper Sculpture Paper Cutout.</p>

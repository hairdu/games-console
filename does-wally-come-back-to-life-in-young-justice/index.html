<p>Even if you down played the speed force its still so absolutely broken that a fraction of what it can do is beyond anything the power scaling in the Young Justice universe can counter. What was perhaps most memorable about Wallys sacrifice is that it did not come in battle against a huge villain but rather in the course of stopping the Reachs schemes on Earth. Ever since her boyfriend Wally WestKid Flash Jason Spisak was killed in Young Justice. Personality Wally West was the Team s resident class clown and goof-ball. Pin On Absolutely No Life.</p>

Even if you down played the speed force its still so absolutely broken that a fraction of what it can do is beyond anything the power scaling in the Young Justice universe can counter. Desperate to see him one last time she turns to Zatanna for help communicating with Wallys spirit. A R C H I V E Young Justice Young Justice League Young Justice Wally.</p>

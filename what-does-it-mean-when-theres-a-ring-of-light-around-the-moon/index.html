<!-- Head tag Code -->
<p><strong>What Does It Mean When Theres A Ring Of Light Around The Moon</strong>, The Moon is Earths only natural satelliteAt about one-quarter the diameter of Earth comparable to the width of Australia it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall and is larger than any known dwarf planetThe Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body. An Optical Illusion Unlike Saturn which has actual physical rings the ring you can sometimes see around the moon is merely an optical illusion. The shape of the ice crystals causes the moonlight to be focused into a ring. A lunar halo also known as a 22-degree halo is a hazy ring that occurs at a radius of approximately 22 degrees around the moon.</p>

<p>A circular rainbow around the Moon also known as a Moonbow lunar halo or lunar rainbow is sometimes caused by the refraction of light through ice particles in high altitude clouds. What does a ring around the moon mean. You need a few conditions for this to be visible the first being the right density of cloud. Halos are caused by the light of the sun or moon passing through a very thin layer of cirruform ice-crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere.</p>

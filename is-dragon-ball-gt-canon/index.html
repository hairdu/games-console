<p>Dragon Ball GT was a short-lived Dragon Ball Z sequel inspired by Akira Toriyamas hit MangaAnime. Youd think canon status would be black and white but for years there were people insisting Dragon Ball GT wasnt canon long before it was officially agreed as non-canon with the release of Dragon Ball Super. But out of the gate everyone knew. Although they went back and retold these stories in the Dragon Ball Super manga and anime replacing the canon of the movies they are still considered semi-canon to this day. The likes of Dragon Ball GT and Super Dragon Ball Heroes are their own beasts not thought of as continuity or part of the main story mostly because they werent penned by Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p>Youre never going to see canon used officially but considering the new film is heavily hyped as overseen by Toriyama and a part of Dragon Balls official history theres a clear hierarchy where the original manga is given some amount of clout over just about anything else. A huge controversy and topic of debate in the Dragon Ball community is in regards to whether or not DBGT is canon or not. It is a minor series which was created by Toei Animation. Obviously this is because Dragon Ball GT was written long before Super but the discrepancies effectively mean the two sequels cant both be considered canon.

<p>Is Dragon Ball GT canon. GT was not created thought up by or even had any input from Toriyama aside from a few character designs. People just say its non-canon because they dont like it.

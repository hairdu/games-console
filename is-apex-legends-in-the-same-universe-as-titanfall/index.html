<p><strong>Is Apex Legends In The Same Universe As Titanfall</strong>, From day one it was evident that both games share the same universe but the extent of this shared universe was unknown. Titanfall on the other hand has a fleshed-out science fiction universe that already has two dedicated games and the added benefit of Apex Legends sharing the setting. Apex Legends takes place over 30 years after the events of Titanfall and Titanfall 2. I believe the only reason respawn made apex is so they can introduce people into the titanfall universe so titanfall 3 wont have the same fate as titanfall 2.</p>

<p>Basically I believe apex legends is just a marketing strategy a really popular and good marketing strategy but I wanna know what everyone else thinks about this. So I have a theory and its about titanfall 3 and apex. Rest assured Titanfall is core to Respawns DNA and this incredible universe. Apex is simply human Vs human or a human sized robot if youre one of the characters.</p>

Battlefield already has something of a shared narrative but its so minuscule that many dont pay it. Despite officially being part of the Titanfall universe the incredibly popular Apex Legends doesnt rely too heavily on its ties to the mech-filled franchise.</p>

At the beginning of the chapter everyone thought that wally was really dead but before the end of the chapter it was revealed that everything Artemis saw was an illusion cast by mgann and zatanna for me that is To give hope that Wally is still alive what I want to get to is that if a producer of a series decides to kill a character in his series the producer decides that he will. Wally West attended the school as a sophomore student during the 20102011 school year. I M Hurt By This But Can T Stop Laughing Young Justice Young Justice League Artemis Crock.</p>

<p>Young Justices season 3 finale gave Artemis the closure she needed regarding Wally Wests death but there was more then met the eye to the reunion. Wally sounded younger than he ever had before to Dick. Iris West-Allen announced on GBS News that it. While Wally didnt fall in love with Linda on Young Justice one of his last thoughts before disappearing in Season 2 was about Artemis. Pin On Young Justice.</p>

<p>Theory about Wally West. - His death wasnt really heroic like his near death in Justice League Unlimited against Luthor-Brainiac was. Because they wanted to move in together and work on making babies to battle the next generation of villains. After the faked death of Artemis and the destruction of Mount Justice Wally and Dick had a falling out because the former did not approve of the risks Nightwing was willing to take for the sake of learning the identity of the Light s new partner.

<!-- Head tag Code -->
<p><strong>What Is A Rainbow Ring Around The Sun Called</strong>, A ring of rainbow forms around the Sun through a phenomenon called Halo that happens because of light interacting with ice crystals in the atmosphere. During the day the rays of light are reflected and refracted by the prism-shaped ice to form a circular rainbow around the sun at a radius of approximately twenty-two degrees. As light passes through these hexagon-shaped ice crystals it is bent at a 22 angle creating a circular halo around the Sun. A Sun halo is caused by the refraction reflection and dispersion of light through ice particles suspended within thin wispy high altitude cirrus or cirrostratus clouds.</p>

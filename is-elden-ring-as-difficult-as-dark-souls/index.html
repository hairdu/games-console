<p>Elden Ring Credit. Lead Writer alongside George RR Martin Hidetaka Miyazaki has compared Elden Rings difficulty at a minimum to match Dark Souls 3 which without means none of FromSoftwares punches will be pulled.

<p>However the game will not punish the player for lack of skill as much. Game director Hidetaka Miyazaki has confirmed that Elden Ring will have a more manageable level of difficulty compared to previous FromSoftware games. You will appriciate the game by how it really is after you get used to it. Miyazaki has weighed in on whether Elden Ring for PS4 will be as hard as Dark Souls Bloodborne and Sekiro.

<p><strong>Did Noble 6 Save Master Chief</strong>, Answer 1 of 6. The Fall of Reach and Halo. Long enough for the Covenant to call in Banshees and Wraiths for backup. Nope Master Chief is not a woman.</p>

<p>CE and Noble 6s death. John-117 at 6 years of age with Halsey deciding his fate with a 21st century quarter. From this we can deduce a few things 1 Noble 6 isnt Master Chief 2 Master Cheif is in the cryo bay in the Pillar of Autumn when Noble 6 transports Cortana 3 Master Chief isnt Cortanas first spartan partner. In the end though master cheif would win simply down to more skill and well luck.</p>

<p>Answer 1 of 6. Mythos Chief was doing the first deleting info about Earths location on Gamma Station before Noble Six delivered Cortanas fragment to the Autumn and probably they left him on stasis because if he knew the Autumn was on Reachs surface he would left the ship to rescue the other SPARTAN-II on the orbital platforms ground. In terms of weapons both Master Chief and Noble 6 carried fleshed out and extremely effective arsenalsMaster Chief does however get a chance to use more weapons then Noble 6 and has used virtually every lethal weapon available in the fight for humanity. So unless someone debriefed him on how the Cortana package made it to him I dont think he would know. So the master chief and noble 6 are the only Spartans that are considered hyper lethal vectors by doctor Halsey so with that in mind they are without a doubt the two most skilled Spartans.</p>

<p>Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 also known simply by his rank as the Master Chief or as is common in military culture simply as the Chief is a Spartan-II supersoldier of the UNSC Navy s Special Weapons division. Theyd probably end up killing each other honestly. Noble 6 is very impressive but the gap between Spartan II and Spartan III is there. He was the only hyper-lethal Spartan besides Master Chief so hes quite a bit better than Locke.

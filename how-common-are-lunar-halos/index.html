<p><strong>How Common Are Lunar Halos</strong>, Without more information focal length etc about the photos its impossible to be sure but it appears as if the top photo is a 22-degree halo while the bottom is a coronaThe former is caused by a thin cloud of ice crystals either near the ground or higher in the atmosphere refracting light at approximately a 22-degree angle so it always appears at the same distance from the light. The halo is large. Scientists call them 22-degree halos. Different Types of Halos There are a few different types of solar halos that you can observe but lets take a look at some of the most common.</p>

<p>With a rainbow blue is on the inside of the arc but in halos red is on the inside of the circle and blue is on the outside. Halos can have many forms ranging from colored or white rings to arcs and spots in the sky. Sun Halo also known as 22 degree halo is an optical phenomenon that occurs due to sunlight refracting in millions of hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Hexagonal shapes are often put forward as the most likely shape.</p>

<p>In fact to the naked eye they appear as faint colourless arches. Stretch out the fingers of your hand at arms length. Lunar halos are mainly colorless since moonlight isnt particularly bright although you may see redder on the interior and bluer on the outside of the halo. When thin clouds scud across a bright moon it is often surrounded by a bright disk and faint coloured rings a lunar corona. Once you do observe a halo around the moon or sun notice how the inner edge is sharper than the outer border.</p>

<p>So this halo has an inner radius of 22 degrees just like the halos of the less-than-super moons. This is rare. Among the best known halo types are the circular halo light pillars. The UP Astronomical Society says Lunar halos are mostly due to refraction of moonlight that passes through ice crystals present in thin clouds when cirrus and cirro-stratus clouds are present in otherwise clear skies.

<p>The interior of the halo is faint red changing to orange and yellow towards the outside and ending with the outer edge in a blue-white color although. It looks like a colourful circle around the Moon or the Sun. In fact to the naked eye they appear as faint colourless arches. The phenomenon is quite rare as the ice crystals have to positioned exactly right in relation to where you are looking up in order for the halo to appear.

<p>The weapons feel unbalanced grenades simply dont work the way the used to plasma pistols dont down vehicles shotguns are powerless the vehicles are frustrating and the actual game engine is BROKE. Reach had unbalanced AAs slow boring gameplay no MP maps shipped with the game as they were all from campaign or Forge World and a lot of the weapons were incredibly unbalanced all of the Covenant weapons were garbage. The Halo 5 campaign wasnt written by the same people who wrote Halo 4 and it shows badly. Even the concept of making Halo Infinite a live-service game is flawed because that just cant function with an active narrative. Yes there are new types of enemy such as charging brute but not that dramatic and only few of them.</p>

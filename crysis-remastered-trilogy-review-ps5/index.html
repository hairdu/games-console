<p><strong>Crysis Remastered Trilogy Review Ps5</strong>, Super sharp 4K resolution visuals coupled with a blistering 60 frames per second framerate not only make Crysis 2 Remastered look the best it ever has on PS5 but also play the best it ever has too. The trilogy has you explore so many different locales from lush forests crumbling city-scapes and alien ruins. The ray tracing is equally impressive yet flawed. This combines with the mostly quality visuals for a package that might finally be able to shed its infamous trappings.</p>

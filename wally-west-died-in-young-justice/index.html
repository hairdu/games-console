So lets pretend that another post about Wally West is something original and lets continue with this I know that everyone wants this character came back even though there is no doubt that he is dead and that the speed force is not existent in YJ according to Greg Weisman but it just doesnt seem right to me for. He died at the end of the Invasion arc in Season 2 when his essence dissipated while stopping bombs set up by the Light and the Reach. Pin On Young Justice.</p>

<p>It was here that Wally apparently died while running at top speed his body seemingly vaporized. Kid Flash Wally West Origin. It was here that Wally apparently died while running at top speed his body seemingly vaporized. Even so Young Justice has not hesitated to kill its protagonists in the past having previously arranged the death of Wally West so theres no reason to believe the series wouldnt also kill Superboy.

<p>A Fandom user 3182013 in Young Justice News Did wally die I dont think he died because when he was running next to the flash he said Artemis is going to kill him for he was doing and thats when flash new what was about to happen to him so my guess if season 3 gets produced maybe atom can create a machine to bring him out of the speed force. Wally was approximately 21 at the time of his death in Young Justice which would roughly fit with the age he appears in the DCAU where he appears to be in his mid 20s or later. Wally also came out of retirement in the season 2 finale in order to help destroy an alien doomsday device that would have destroyed all life on Earth. Kid Flash Wally West Origin.

<p>No one attended his funeral. Ben has a role to play just like everyone else. Until the LOSTies arrived Ben had been the leader of the Others and seemed poised to become the next guardian of the island. Ben and Locke next visit a pit full of long-deceased Dharma members where Ben shoots Locke because Locke threatens his leadership of the Others. Everything John Locke Said On Season 5 Of Lost Terry O Quinn John Locke Lost Tv Show.</p>

<p>I think the reason why Ben killed Locke is because he wouldnt allow Locke to commit suicide and he needed him to be strong for his future on the island. Ben has a role to play just like everyone else. Desmond hit locke because he thought it was really locke who pushed him down the well he was trying to kill him in the alt timeline as a result. Ben knew if Locke got to Eloise then hed be able to get back and reclaim leadership of the island so Ben kills him and takes his place in getting the others back to the island through Eloise.

<p>Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and it was immediately apparent he was a key figure in Star Wars lore. According to Palpatine he was a Sith Lord who had learned the secret of immortality - but was slain by his apprentice. Legends and 64 are my favorite Castlevanias and they arent canon for arbitrary reasons I mean if the timeline wasnt full of retcons and inconsistencies I wouldnt mind but its not like these 2 games ruin the timeline somehow. If something is referenced in a Legends story &ndash; anything outside the movies written before 2014 &ndash; its not considered part of the Canon.</p>

<p>According to Palpatine he was a Sith Lord who had learned the secret of immortality - but was slain by his apprentice. Because the movies and TCW and basically George Lucas in particular would sometimes disregard or contradict existing works C-canon was only really canon so long as it was never contradicted by G- and T-canon stories. Disney still controls that and they want their own canon. Castlevania Legends cant be blamed for not adhering to the IGA canon at that point because IGA was a relative nobody back then and his canon hadnt been set yet.

<p>Legends that isnt canon. Rebels New Thrawn Trilogy R1 and Vader comics are fine. This is a subreddit devoted to the game League of Legends. Before this timeline came out it was all nebulous dates and times and there was no real reason why Legends couldnt co-exist with the other games in the franchise until IGA flat-out said that it didnt - probably because he had the story for Lament of Innocence in his mind and wanted that to be the real start of the Belmont clan.

<p>Rather than announcing the decanonization of the EU after all you cant decanonize what was never canon to begin with Lucasfilm simply announced that the EU would be rebranded as Legends and from then on all novels comic books video games and television shows will be on the same level of canon as the films and The Clone Wars.

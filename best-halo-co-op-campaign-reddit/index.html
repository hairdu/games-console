<p>I appreciate that not a lot of people will not care about the campaign not having coop but for me and many others it is like a tradition. While Halo Infinites campaign is available and can be considered one of the best Xbox games available co-op play was not included at the games launch. Yes I understand asking for another story campaign is crazy and we see what we got in 7 years. All with a collection of relatively diverse maps.

<p>Load halo infinite campaign. Couch co-op as we mostly call it in Halo Infinite you can play on a shared screen just like the feature for split screen on the Gears of War franchise only better. I also remember collecting all the skulls in Halo 3 with my siblings and getting hayabusa together. This means around May 2022 but no official date has been confirmed and 343 Industries did not.

<p>2nd player has no HUD. Press start on main controller. I hope that somehow we get a miracle and Infinite launches with co-op campaign. My Xbox one came with the halo master chief collection.

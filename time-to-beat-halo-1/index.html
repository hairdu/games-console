<p>The full length of the Halo Infinite campaign will take most players at least eight hours to beat. Thank you all so much for the awards on this truly terrible shitpost. To sum it all up the range is roughly five to 10 hours. I beat the halo 3 campaign on NORMAL so im a veteran of this series and i feel like i deserve more.

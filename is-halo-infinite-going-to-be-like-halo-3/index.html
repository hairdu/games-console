Its so much faster paced to the point where I dont think playing halo 3 will help you as much as playing other modern fps games as someone else here has mentioned. Arceus are at the top of my list but Im also excited to check out God of War Ragnarok Dying Light 2 Breath of the Wild 2 Suicide Squad Redfall and much much more.

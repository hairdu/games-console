<p>If you like all those bells and whistles and prefer your music to sound compressed and loud the remasters are better. Yes it does matter. If all you want is the album the way it originally sounded the first release is best. By definition the process takes at least twice as long meaning that time can play a part in the decision as to whether or not a record receives half-speed treatment.

<p>Modern remasters should always sound better due to noise reduction proper audio levels balance correction corrected eq curves and dynamic compression levels that only enhance and balance the sound of the original release. Hence record labels have found it to be a means by which loyal fans can buy their favourite albums again. In almost all aspects a half-speed master will sound better so why arent all vinyl records mastered at half speed. But the 2015 iTunes versions are still loud and compressed and dont sound as warm and rich as the original 1980s CapitolEMI or Castle.

<p>Hence record labels have found it to be a means by which loyal fans can buy their favourite albums again. Some people believe remastered albums are better but some dont. In other words in the US they may run 100000 cds of the new Sting cd and in Japan they may run 1000 less room for mistakes. But the 2015 iTunes versions are still loud and compressed and dont sound as warm and rich as the original 1980s CapitolEMI or Castle.

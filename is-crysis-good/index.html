<p>I always felt that Crysis was better suited to open worlds like the original especially so due to the engine which makes me personally just want to walk around slowly and test the environment the island itself being a gorgeous locationthat exploration factor coupled with the super-powered Nano-Suit that allowed for fun shit like super speeding into a base and punching the terrified. Considering that the Crysis games dont cost that much anymore especially on Steam I would say yes. Crysis Remastered reminds us of a time when AAA PC games werent hindered by console ports. The gameplay just isnt nearly as smooth as the final two games in the core. Crysis 3 Character Art Image Heavy.</p>

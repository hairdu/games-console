A remaster means adjusting the quality of the individual tracks on the original song in an attempt to improve it but the original structure of the song stays intact. The original CD has a finished-off single version of Yesterday Once More while the Remastered Classics version is the slightly unfinished album version from the original LP.</p>

<p>Overall I personally like the Arranged one better. When too many copies have been made the master begins to wear out. A remix is often a new interpretation to suit radio play club or DJ play for artistic purposes or to reach a different audience. The result does not sound the same as the original song.

<p><strong>Why Did Bungie Sell Halo Reddit</strong>, After seeing all the Halo-inspired weapons added to Destiny today I have come to hypothesize that there were rights issues between Bungie and Microsoft. Since Microsoft owned Halo Bungie had to give it up in order to achieve that goal. Then we have Halo 4 the first completely new title 343 made.

The folks at Bungie were ready to move on from Halo by Halo 3 and Bungie Corporation which was actually a part of Microsoft wanted to get started working on new IPs Destiny being one of them but they were contractually obligated to create at least two more Halo titles as their ticket to separate amicably. Then we have Halo 4 the first completely new title 343 made.</p>

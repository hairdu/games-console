<p>Sundogs are colored spots of light that develop due to the refraction of light through ice crystals. Occasionally brighter areas will form along these halos creating a mock Sun or sundog Sundogs are known as parhelia or the singular parhelion to astronomers from the Greek words meaning beside the Sun. Cirrostratus clouds are thin high-altitude clouds composed of ice crystals. For example in South Asia Hindus believe the appearance of a Solar Halo is the gathering of the gods of thunder and lightning and serves as a precursor to a storm.

<p>A rainbow ring around the sun means that the suns rays are passing through ice crystal in cirrostratus clouds at a 22-degree angle. Of course its shape can only be seen using a microscope. A halo is a ring or light that forms around the sun or moon as the sun or moon light refracts off ice crystals present in a thin veil of cirrus clouds. These clouds are characterized as thin and wispy strands of ice that form in the cold region of the atmosphere typically at around 18000-21000 feet or more above the surface of the planet.

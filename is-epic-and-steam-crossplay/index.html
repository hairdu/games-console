<p><strong>Is Epic And Steam Crossplay</strong>, Yes Killing Floor 2 does feature cross platform multiplayer between Epic Games and Steam. With the new update you can activate the option from the settings as in the videoIt has been activated with the update that came with the date of 09092021. With Epic Games constantly giving away games for free every week nine times out of ten your friend will have gotten a multiplayer game off of their store rather than from Steam.
